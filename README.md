# Earth
This project, having been a staple project of mine for the last several years consists of various implementations of the same sort of project; an OpenGL rendered globe. With the Google Earth view seen in Google Maps being the inspiration and goal. Utilizing languages such as Java, ideomatic C and C++ as vectors of implementation. Further details pertaining to each codebase can be found in their own respective directories within the [implementation folder](./Implementations/).
